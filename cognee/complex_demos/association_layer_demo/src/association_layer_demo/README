This is a demo project to showcase and test how cognee and CrewAI can work together:

Short description:

There were two basic agents implemented:

1 - Data Ingestion Expert:
    - Performs google search about cognee using Serper (SERPER_API_KEY is needed).
    - Ingests all the search results into cognee metastore using cognee.add
    - Performs cognify step using the cognee.cognify

2 - Cognee Search Expert
    - Uses the cognee.search (graph completion, other search tools can be added)
    - Asks multiple questions to research what is cognee


The following tools were implemented:
    - Serper search tool: Searches the internet via google (Ingestion AGENT)
    - Cognee add: adds google search results to cognee's metastore (Ingestion AGENT)
    - Cognee cognify: cognifies the added documents (Ingestion AGENT)
    - Cognee Search searches the cognee memory (Search AGENT)

Tried but not the part of the pushed code:
    - agents delegating each other
    - collaboration and communication via pydantic
    - File reading and directory discovery using agents + file ingestion into cognee


In general agents are working together to search what cognee is, ingest the knowledge into cognee
build the knowledgegraph and perform different searches to collect the knowledge about cognee.


Works from IDE and not from CLI,(one import has to be changed then)
